# fit-meal

(Still in development)

I'm developing a fitness tracker web app that will enable users to track their daily calorie, macronutrient and water intake and also track their habits like exercising. Users will have access to the food and exercise database. One of the functionalities is also a meal planner that can make a perfect meal based on the user's personalized needs using optimiyation algorithms.

Backend is developed in ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. It follows the MVC pattern and consists of RESTful API Controllers, Models and Data Access. Data is stored in a local Microsoft SQL Server, database management is done through Entity Framework Core and SQL Server Management Studio. 

Frontend is developed in React. Authorization is present in both the backend and the frontend and it is done through JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
